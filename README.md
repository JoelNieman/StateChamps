# StateChamps
Mobile Application for the State Champs! television show.

1) Current working condition and functionality.
2) Installation requirements
3) API Keys

--------------------------------------------------------------

1.1 - The State Champs! app is being developed initially for the iPhone 6 Plus screen size. Constraints and views will subsequently be updated to make the app ideal for all relevant iPhone screen sizes as well as iPads.

1.2 - Design has been left fairly basic as I will be working with the State Champs! staff designer to improve the UI in the coming weeks.

1.3 - YouTube and Twitter API's are not currently active. Twitter is #1 priority, YouTube is #2. Long-term position is to create an API for the State Champs! owned servers and move away from YouTube.

1.4 - Map is not yet fully integrated with the native maps app for directions.

1.5 - User content / camera functionality is not yet fully functional. Functionality and requirements will be reviewed with the State Champs! team as this will require resources to manage after deployment to app store.



2.1 - The State Champs! app uses the YouTubePlayer CocoaPod. After cloning/downloading the project, navigate into the project directory and run "pod install." Use the XCWorkspace file after doing so.



3.1 - API keys are not being uploaded to GitHub for the State Champs! app. If you would like to add YouTube/Twitter/FB API calls, you will need to create a plist file called ApiKeys and add your keys to this dictionary.
